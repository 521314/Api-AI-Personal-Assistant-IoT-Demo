Barry 2.0 - An AI personal assistant powered by Api.ai
========

An app that shows how to use the Api.ai HTML and JS SDK to build a simple AI personal assistant. This is version 2.0 which runs on Node.js and hooks into the Jawbone UP API to retrieve sleep data as an example of IoT connectivity..

If you build your own personal assistant from this code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com. I'd love to have a look!

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I also write all about emerging tech over at [Dev Diner](http://www.devdiner.com) (http://www.devdiner.com)!
